## Description

I was just hired at a marketing agency to review their current codes and make it meet accessibility standards of today. This also requires that the site is optimized for search engines. 

This project involves taking existing HTML and CSS codes and to improve it without changing the primary function of the code. This is called refactor. This was done to meet the requirement of making the existing website accessible for people with disabilities that cannot access the website. 

This project helped me get acquintanted with HTML and CSS. This project will help me to development a good framework for how to write my HTML and CSS codes going forward in class, job, or career. 

This project stands out for me because it was the first time I heard of the term "accessibility" and symantic elements. 

Here is a link to the deployed project.
