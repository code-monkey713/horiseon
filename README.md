This is Horiseon Social Solution marketing agency website that was refactored to meet accessibility and SEO ready. 

## Description

I was just hired at a marketing agency to review their current codes and make it meet accessibility standards of today. This also requires that the site is optimized for search engines. 

This project involves taking existing HTML and CSS codes and to improve it without changing the primary function of the code. This was done to meet the requirement of making the existing website accessible for people with disabilities that cannot access the website.
